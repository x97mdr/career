### Experience

**Saba Software** *Manager, Software Development* __February 2018 to June 2019__

I moved back into a managerial role, remotely, with my old team in Quebec City.  My key accomplishments were:

- Leading the first development effort in Saba Cloud by former TalentSpace developers.  This involved a lot of coordination and cooperation with Saba Cloud colleagues in California and India.
- Successfully delivered several key features for the TalentSpace product.
- Guided the team in a transition from 3-week to 1-week sprints.

**Saba Software** *Software Development Manager* __October 2017 to February 2018__

After moving back to my home province of Nova Scotia, I worked as an
individual contributor developing software to support development operations,
with a focus on financial reporting systems. The software that I developed:

- supported our SR&ED applications and provided guidance to finance on
intellectual property ownership of the software formerly owned by Halogen.
- Provided actionable insights to development teams and leadership by
importing data from software that we used to support development. Importing
of data was done with Spring Batch/Spring Cloud Data Flow using apps written
with Kotlin. Data cleanup, data processing and visualizations were done in
Python with Pandas and matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Acted as a subject matter expert in specification by example (aka behaviordriven development) for our software analysts, leveraging my years of
experience in this area to provide guidance for them as they worked with
teams and other stakeholders.

**Saba Software** *Manager, Software Development* __May 2017 to October 2017__

After Halogen was acquired I continued in my role as a manager on the platform team, but I was also given responsibility for our learning team.

I led the team that delivered a critical upgrade to a core piece of our learning product's infrastructure.  My other teams delivered a number of features in the core product as well.

**Saba Software** *Manager, Software Development* __January 2015 to May 2017__

Manager on the platform team, leading several diverse teams on the platform supporting customers and developers.  My teams delivered:

- Object storage solution for large documents to help the company save money on database licensing for storage and backup.
- A new unified installer, offering a better install experience for our on-premise customers and developers.
- An upgrade of application servers.  This was a complex, multi-release project that required communication with many different stakeholders.
- Improved build and test times that had a significant impact on product quality.

I supported my teams with weekly or bi-weekly one-on-ones and team meetings.  I supported the larger platform team by acting as a liaison between our Quebec City and Ottawa offices.  Working closely with product and platform teams to build better relationships and ensure successful delivery.

I also led and advised on several initiatives outside of my management role to benefit the company: 

- Led and advised on our department's move to an agile methodology.  I organized scrum training for the entire department and worked with teams to help them adjust to the new way of working.  I led our initiative to move from 3-week to 2-week sprints.
- Participated in the Culture Club, representing software development. As part of this, I was an early participant/leader in developing our move from an annual appraisal culture to a feedback-oriented culture.
- Acted as a mentor for others in the department.

**Statistics Canada** *Senior Technical Lead* __2012 to 2015__

Technical lead for 20+ developers on the Collection Management Portal (CMP) project.  This software was intended to become the one piece of software that ran every survey that Statistics Canada conducted and would replace dozens of existing systems and methodologies.  I originally started the project doing business analysis using Specification by Example/Behavior Driven Development, but transitioned to technical lead based on staffing requirements.

Key accomplishments:

- Successfully delivered software for the first major milestone release (the Census 2016 behavioral test).
- Developed the logging infrastructure (elasticsearch-logstash-kibana) used to monitor the nodes of our application in all environments.
- Developed a standard data set for use in both unit tests and for populating a local database to help developers test features quickly and easily.
- Developed a sandbox project to help new developers get up to speed.
- Migrated the database migration tool from Flyway to Liquibase.  After some time I also led the development of a new liquibase baseline to make migrations faster.
- Ran monthly team retrospectives to improve the way that we worked.
- Focused on quality by training the team on test-driven development and behavior-driven development and participating in code reviews.

Outside of my technical lead role, I ran several initiatives for the benefit of other developers in the agency:

- Administered the Jira and Subversion instances for Statistics Canada.  This involved everything from provisioning servers and developing disaster recovery plans to helping new teams figure out how to setup their Jira project with workflows/fields/screens and import existing repositories into subversion.
- Spearheaded Behavior Driven Development (BDD) at Statistics Canada.  This involved over a dozen presentations to different teams and follow-on advice and guidance.

**Statistics Canada** *Project Leader* __2007 to 2012__

Led a small team of 3-5 persons developing systems in C# and ASP.NET to support the Edit and Imputation Task of the Canadian Census of Population.

Focused on batch processing systems and some small web applications.

- Re-wrote large, complex system from scratch with C# using object-oriented design techniques.
- Used Behavior Driven Development to analyze requirements and build an automated test suite for applications.
- Used Test Driven Development to assist in good design and prevent regressions.
- Pioneered Kanban implementation at Statistics Canada.
