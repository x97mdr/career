## Motivation for this document

Getting a new manager can be an anxious experience.   I have had new managers as well, so I understand that and that's why I'm writing this document to give you a better idea what to expect in our interactions and how I can help you in your career.

I view my role as twofold: the first to guide you in your career to wherever you may want to go; the second is to guide you, as a component of the team, to success.  We will talk weekly in a 1:1, and a few times a year those will become career conversations where we talk about where you want to be in your career.  We will work to set goals for you to achieve and help you identify the steps you need to achieve them.

## What do I value most?

I really value team players.  By this I mean people who are good communicators, display empathy for others on their team and will roll up their sleeves to try new things to get that new feature across the finish line.

Good communication to me means that you focus on specific facts and use examples to communicate your intent.  Use a unit test, code snippet, wireframe sketch or log snippet to illustrate your point.

Displaying empathy is a part of understanding your teammates and your customers' needs.  We're all building software for someone with someone, I need you to know what problems they have and how you can help solve them.

Rolling up your sleeves means you're willing to try new things.  Sometimes, as a developer you might need to do some manual testing to get the product to the finish line.  Other times, you may be called on to help manage the build tool.  I appreciate people willing to learn and try these new things.  Software today is more than just your language/framework of choice ... there is a whole host of tools and techniques that one needs to be a successful software developer.

## My Expectations

My door is always open (or my camera always on remotely) so if you have a question, need my help with something or just want someone to talk with then pop in and say hello.  No need to schedule something in advance.

It's OK to make a mistake.  I want you to bring those up as soon as possible, in case I need to help to fix it.  In fact, ï»¿I distrust anyone who says they haven't failed.  Things will go wrong, some things will not turn out as expected and you might feel that you will disappoint me.  That's OK, it's part of the learning process and to be expected.  Trust in me to do the right thing by you.

I measure success by the outcomes we have on the people that use the software we write.  That database query or REST API might be the most beautiful piece of code known to humanity, but if it doesn't make someone's job faster or better then I am not going to use it as a yardstick of success.  You'll often hear me talk about vertical slices of functionality.

I expect everyone who works for me to be an adult.  I'm OK with just about any working arrangement as long as it allows yourself and the team to get your work done and be successful.  Working remote, or working from home are fine.  Depending on the job role, I might require a way to reach you outside of working hours.

## 1:1s

These are my favorite part of the week ... where we get to know each other.

I like to keep 1:1s informal, and often start off with a bit of conversation about what's going on in your life and/or my own.
I am expecting you to drive the meetings so come prepared with topics of discussion or questions you may have.  We will talk about goals and give each other feedback on how we think we're doing.  

While we can talk about "the work" there are other opportunities for that and I don't want our 1:1 to turn into a status report.

## Personality quirks

I am pretty easy to get along with and have a reputation as a really nice person.  I like to illustrate points or give advice with stories and analogies, and I have a lot of them!

I avoid trying to be directive with my teams.  I feel you'll grow more as a person if I help you understand what's important and guide you to the right answer as opposed to telling you the right answer right away.  Some people might find this frustrating at first.

In larger groups, at work or on an outing, I tend to sit back and listen.  I want to hear what people have to say before offering opinions or positions.  Although, if no one is offering conversation, I will fill in the gap!

I don't like organizing events, but will if I have to.  If you're on my team and you like organizing lunches or team activities ... expect that to be delegated to you :)

## Where to focus on your first 90 days?

When you first join my team, I want you to focus on getting to know the other team members and our customers.  You should know the types of problems our customers have and what your role is in trying to solve them.

Bring your whole self to our 1:1.  I don't want to just know you as a developer, but you as a person.  I think it's important in building trust.

If you want to know how you're doing, just ask.  I'm pretty open and will let you know where you stand on the team.  This should be a regular topic of conversation in our 1:1.
